front-end 


active was not defined in locales variables of english and bad order of buttons. 

Active button was not filterring all items, I still dont know if 
return !todo.checked ||  todo.checked is correct. I believe that other solution could be nicer.?  

Counter was counting only Active -> calling function with bad arguments 

I added space between date and time because of better reading 

Check of todos was set to first todo everytime 

On starting page was not set All todos should be picked
